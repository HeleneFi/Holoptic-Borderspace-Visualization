Holoptic Borderspace Visualization
==================================

How parts of a whole can see the whole evolve and the relationships between parts in action.

- Giving participants of a community a live perception of the whole in various dimensions (not only social graph). 

 > See [Holopticism such as illustrated by JF Noubel](http://wiki.thetransitioner.org/English/Holopticism): "Each player, thanks to his/her experience and expertise, relates to the whole in order to adjust his/her actions and coordinate them with others' moves. Therefore there is an unceasing round trip, a feedback loop that works like a mirror between the individual level and the collective one."

- Finding overlaps and relations between object and identify synergies across multiple dimensions (it can be across disciplines, domains, projects, cultures, communities, interests...)

 > [Borderspaces and borderlinks such as described by Bracha Ettinger here](http://www.theoldbrandnew.nl/knowledge.html): borderspaces at the junction of things, borderlinks created via fluctuation of distance in proximity to create relations without relationships, where traces produced are shearable between subjects in trans-subjective relationships -start at 10'
