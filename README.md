Visualizations for Systemic Change
==================================

Visualization of stigmergetic feedback: how parts of a whole can see the whole evolve and the relationships between parts in action, where gaps can be identified, needs fulfilled, possibilities explored and impacts vizualized. For application to stigmergetic project see [here](https://github.com/HeleneFi/VisuializingStigmergy).

- Giving the agents the possibility of the perception of the whole in various dimensions (not only social graph). 

 > With [Holopticism, such as introduced by JF. Noubel](http://www.slideshare.net/AlanRosenblith/holopticism), "Each player, thanks to his/her experience and expertise, relates to the whole in order to adjust his/her actions and coordinate them with others' moves. Therefore there is an unceasing round trip, a feedback loop that works like a mirror between the individual level and the collective one."
 
 > [Anoptism introduced by O.Auber](http://p2pfoundation.net/Anoptism) brings the nuance that there is also always an invisible architecture, that we cannot see, but which nevertheless influences and determines our behavioural choices. It mourns the idea of "totality" of this space and of the "objectivity" of its representation, insisting instead on the arbitrary and subjectivity of the many points of view of which everyone is potentially an author, and the actor of the rules and codes they generate. The [Poietic Generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poietic_Generator#Perspectives) illustrates the process of self-organization at work in the continuous emergence of the global picture.
 
 > Both the Holoptic and the Anoptic project are a modeled representation of the space in which the actors evolve, in opposition to the Panopticon where one agent observes all the others without their knowing. The three are represented [here](https://sites.google.com/site/arkandiskm/connaissance-et-organisation/ecosysteme-du-km/intelligence-collective/panoptique-holoptique-anoptique). 
 
 
- Enabling navigation of the adjacent possible, discovery and learning 

 > See [Navigating the Possibility Space ](https://github.com/HeleneFi/linked-data-exploration-graph) that bring to life the 'adjacent possible' proposed by Struart Kaufman: "The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations. Think of it as a house that magically expands with each door you open. You begin in a room with four doors, each leading to a new room that you haven't visited yet. Once you open one of those doors and stroll into that room, three new doors appear, each leading to a brand-new room that you couldn't have reached from your original starting point. Keep opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace." Stephen Johnson, The Origins of Good Ideas, WSJ Sept 2011. 
 
 > The [Johari Window](http://www.geo.coop/story/zegg-forum-and-johari-window) opens up on self-awareness and shared discovery of the unknown, to expand the boundaries of our perception.

- Finding overlaps and relations between object and identify synergies across multiple dimensions (it can be across disciplines, domains, projects, cultures, communities, interests...)

 > [Borderspaces and borderlinks such as described by Bracha Ettinger here](http://www.theoldbrandnew.nl/knowledge.html) creates trans-subjective relationships: borderspaces at the junction of things, borderlinks created via fluctuation of distance in proximity to create relations without relationships, where traces produced are shearable between subjects -start at 10'

- Seing what is produced, at work, in its context, while it is produced.

 > Bret Victor talks of creating [environments that nurture ideas](http://vimeo.com/36579366): Creators need an immediate connection to what they create, to see the effect of their changes immediately. We need to find new medium that can listen to our hands as we create, so that we can unlock the pieces that are locked in our heads and nurture the ideas that must be grown. We need environments in which ideas can grow and creators can nurture them. Individually and collectively.
